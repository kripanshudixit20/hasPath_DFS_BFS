# hasPath_DFS_BFS
hasPath function checks whether a path from source node to a destination node is possible in a given graph or not.
The given graph is in the form of a HashMap<String, String[]>, src is the source node and dest is the destination node.
Both function for BFS and DFS traversal are defined and called separately from the main function.
DFS function unitlized the stacking property of recursive calling and the BFS function uses the java util class Queue<> to implement BFS traversal.
